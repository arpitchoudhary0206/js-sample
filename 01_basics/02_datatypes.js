// Data types
/*  Primitive Data types
number range 2 to the power 53
bigint = large numbers
string = ""
boolean = true/false
null => standalone value
    let's say asking server to give temperature, now if it is sending 0 then it is a temperature value so in this case it will return null
undefined => not defined
symbol = to define uniqueness

Not primitive data types
object
console.log(type of "arpit") => string
console.log(type of null) => object
console.log(type of undefined) => undefined because it is a type
